# resource-pack
hey here's an oCd inspired resource pack i'm working on. there are seperate textures for each block on the side to give it depth.

for best results use [optifne](https://optifine.net/downloads) with connected textures on fancy.

Note: it contains absolutely 0% copyrighted materials and any and all things in here are free to plagarize for yourself
